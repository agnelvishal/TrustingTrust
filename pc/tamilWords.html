Here's what happened in the climax of movie “The Dark Knight”.
<br><br>

The villain forces people to two ships. Each ship is given a remote to blow up the other ship.
If both ships do not use the remote, villain will blow both the ships. <b>So kill or be killed.</b>
<br><br>
What will you do in this situation? <br>
Lets see what is the best response by looking at a similar game.

<b>THE GAME OF TRUST</b>
<br>
You have one choice.
In front of you is a machine: if you put a coin in the machine,
the <i>other player</i> gets three coins – and vice versa.
You both can either choose to COOPERATE (put in coin), or CHEAT (don't put in coin).
</p>

<p id="oneoff_0_btm">
<b>Let's say the other player cheats, and doesn't put in a coin.</b><br>
What should you do?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_cheated">
Exactly! Why let opponent take advantage of you?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_cooperated">
Sadly, your opponent took advantage of you.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_top">
If you cooperate &amp; he cheats, you lose a coin while he gains three. (score: -1 vs +3)
However, if you both cheat, neither of you gain or lose anything. (score: 0 vs 0)
<b>Therefore: you should CHEAT.</b>
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_btm">
<b>But let's say the other player cooperates, and puts in a coin.</b><br>
What should you do now?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_cheated">
Wow, that's mean... and also the correct answer!
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_cooperated">
Sure, seems like the right thing to do... <b>OR IS IT??</b>
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_top">
Because if you both cooperate, you both give up a coin to gain three. (score: +2 vs +2)
But if you cheat &amp; he cooperates, you gain three coins at their cost of one. (score: +3 vs -1)
<b>Therefore: you "should" still CHEAT.</b>
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_btm">
And <i>that's</i> our dilemma.
Trust is nice, but it can let others pull you down as you try helping them.
Sometimes, distrust is rational!
But now, what happens if we play this game...

<!-- - - - - EVOLUTION! - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="evolution_intro">
Now, let's let our population of players <i>evolve over time</i>. It's a 3-step dance:
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_1">
<b>1. PLAY A TOURNAMENT</b><br>
Let them all play against each other, and tally up their scores.
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_2">
<b>2. ELIMINATE LOSERS</b><br>
Get rid of the 5 worst players.

<p id="evolution_intro_3">
<b>3. REPRODUCE WINNERS</b><br>
Replace the 5 worst players with 5 best players.
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_footer">
...and REPEAT, for as long as you'd like.
Note: you don't have to wait for people to literally die &amp; reproduce for culture to evolve --
all that's needed is that "unsuccessful" behaviors go away, and "successful" behaviors are imitated.
So now...
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_button">
...let's see this in action. &rarr;
</p>

<p id="evo_1">
Say we start with the following population of players:
<span class="all_c">15 Always Cooperates</span>,
<span class="all_d">5 Always Cheats</span>, and
<span class="tft">5 Copycats</span>.
(We'll ignore <span class="grudge">Rational</span> &amp; <span class="prober">Sherlock</span> for now)
<br><br>
We're going to do the tournament-eliminate-reproduce dance a dozen times or so.
Let's make another bet! Who do you think will win the <i>first</i> tournament?
<b>PLACE YOUR BETS, AGAIN:</b>
</p>

<p id="evo_2_all_c">
Makes sense, <span class="all_c">Always Cooperate</span> outnumbers everyone else right now...
</p>
<p id="evo_2_all_d">
Makes sense, <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> has a lot of <span class="all_c">Always Cooperates</span> to exploit...
</p>
<p id="evo_2_tft">
Makes sense, <span class="tft">Copycat</span> won the tournament last time, why not again?...
</p>
<p id="evo_2">
Let's see if you're correct:
</p>

<p id="label_play_tournament">
1) play tournament
</p>
<p id="label_eliminate_bottom_5">
2) eliminate bottom 5
</p>
<p id="label_reproduce_top_5">
3) reproduce top 5
</p>

<p id="evo_3_all_c">
Alas, <span class="all_c">Always Cooperate</span> got eaten up by
<span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span>, whose numbers have now increased by 5.
</p>
<p id="evo_3_all_d">
Sadly, you were correct! The <span class="all_d">Always Cheaters</span> won this time,
and their numbers increased by 5.
</p>
<p id="evo_3_tft">
Alas, <span class="tft">Copycat</span> did not win – but at least they didn't do as bad
as <span class="all_c">Always Cooperate</span>. They got eaten up by <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span>,
whose numbers have now increased by 5.
</p>
<p id="evo_3">
But let's try a few more rounds of this...
</p>

<p id="evo_4">
<span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> is still growing,
at the expense of <span class="all_c">Always Cooperate</span>...
</p>

<p id="evo_5">
And now, all the <span class="all_c">Always Cooperates</span> are dead.
But, wait...
</p>

<p id="evo_6">
That's right: the <span class="all_d">Always Cheats</span> became a victim of their own success!
They exploited the naive <span class="all_c">Always Cooperators</span>,
but once they ran out of them, they had to face the <span class="tft">Copycats</span>:
who <i>are</i> nice, but not naive.
</p>

<p id="evo_7">
By simply copying the other player's moves,
<span class="tft">Copycats</span> can play nice with each other,
while <span class="all_d">Always Cheats</span> just cheat themselves!
Not only that, but it also means <span class="tft">Copycat</span>
can give <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span>
a taste of their own medicine.
</p>

<p id="evo_8">
And so, as a result...
</p>

<p id="evo_9">
...<span class="tft">Copycat</span> inherits the earth.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_all_c">
So, although your bet was off -- the nice-but-naive <span class="all_c">Always Cooperators</span>
were doomed from the start -- in the end, a <i>smart</i> form of niceness prevailed,
and the <span class="all_d">Always Cheaters</span> were squashed.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_all_d">
So, in the short run you were right - <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> won the first few rounds,
but in the end, its exploitativeness was its downfall.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_tft">
So, in the long run, you were right - <span class="tft">Copycat</span> wins!
<span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> may have won in the short run,
but its exploitativeness was its downfall.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_end">
This reminds me of a quote:
<br><br>
<i>"We are punished by our sins, not for them."</i><br>
~ Elbert Hubbard
</p>
<p id="evo_9_btn">
(oh, and by the way...)
</p>

<p id="evo_10">
(...this result is similar even if we put
<span class="grudge">Rational</span> &amp; <span class="prober">Sherlock</span> back in:)
</p>

<p id="evo_autoplay">
start the evolution process!
</p>
<p id="evo_autoplay_stop">
stop the evolution process
</p>

<p id="evo_10_followup">
(Note: sometimes, a few <span class="grudge">Rationals</span> may stick around,
because when all players except <span class="grudge">Rational</span> &amp; <span class="tft">Copycat</span>
are eliminated, the two tie.)
<br><br>
So, it seems the math of game theory is telling us something:
that <span class="tft">Copycat's</span> philosophy,
"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you", may be not just a
<i>moral</i> truth, but also a <i>mathematical</i> truth.
However...
</p>
<p id="evo_10_btn">
...there's a problem: &rarr;
</p>

<p id="evo_11">

If <span class="tft">Copycat</span> strategy in this game of trust is so powerful --
that even superpowers in the cold war "evolved" a similar strategy, called "live and let live" --
why, then, did it disturb peace?<b> Why are so many people unhappy with their life copying what others do?</b>
What's causing our epidemic of un-trust where everyone looks for their own selfish goals?
<br><br>
Now lets see from different angle.
So far we've only talked about change in the players:
what about <i>a change in the game?</i>
What could lead to...
</p>
<p id="evo_11_btn">
...the evolution of <i>distrust?</i>
</p>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - DISTRUST - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="distrust_1">
Before everything goes to chaos, let's start with something nice!
Here's a world filled entirely with <span class="all_c">Always Cooperates</span>,
except for one <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> and one <span class="tft">Copycat</span>.
<br><br>
Use the buttons on the right to <b>START</b> the sim,
go through it <b>step-by-step</b>, or <b>reset</b> it. &rarr;
</p>

<p id="distrust_2">
As you already know, <span class="tft">Copycat</span> wins handily in the long run,
under our current rules!
<br><br>
But that's under our <i>current</i> rules, which say that
players play against each other for <i>10</i> rounds per match.
Does <span class="tft">Copycat</span> still win at 7 rounds? 5 rounds? 3? 2? 1?
<br><br>
<b>Change the number of rounds</b> with the slider below,
then <b>START</b> the sim, and see what happens.
Feel free to experiment!
</p>

<p id="distrust_2_end">
once you're done playing around, click:
</p>

<p id="distrust_3">
As you saw, if you don't play enough rounds, (here: 5 or less)
<span class="all_d">ALWAYS CHEAT</span> dominates. The fewer "interactions" there are, the more distrust will spread.
<br>
In 1985, when people were asked how many deep meaningful friends they had,
the most common answer was "3". In 2004, the most common answer was <i>"0"</i>.
<br>Today we do have fun with our friends -- but talks from inside are rare.
How many of us can appreciate the silence in a Mani Ratnam film? Today noise filled Kuppa Padam are more popular.

</p>
<p id="distrust_3_btn">
and oh, it gets worse... &rarr;
</p>

<p id="distrust_4">
There's <i>another</i> way to breed distrust.
Here are the "rewards and punishments" for the trust game:
</p>
<p id="distrust_4_2">
With the normal rewards, <span class="tft">Copycat</span> wins.
But now, <b>change the "both cooperate" reward from +2 to +1</b>,
then click <b>START</b>.
Even though +1 is still <i>more</i> than the punishment for both cheating (0)...
what happens?
</p>
<p id="distrust_4_note">
feel free to play around with different rewards!
once you're done, click:
</p>
<p id="distrust_4_note_2">
(simulating: 10 rounds per match)
</p>

<p id="distrust_5">
The same thing happens:
with a lower "win-win" reward, <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> takes over.
We have 2 well known conclusions from this
<br>
<b>"Zero-sum game".</b> This is the sadly common belief that a gain for "us"
<i>must</i> come at a loss to "them", and vice versa. Common in sports and war.
<br>
<b>"Non-zero-sum game".</b> This is when people make the hard effort
to create a win for all. An example would be a minister making efficient use of money instead of collecting more taxes.
Without the non-zero-sum game, <i>trust cannot evolve.</i>
<br>
Speaking of which,
let's now look at our third &amp; final barrier to Trusting Trust...

<p id="noise_evo_4_2_incorrect">
Good guess, but someone else took the prize --
</p>
<p id="noise_evo_4_2">
<span class="tf2t">Copykitten</span> wins this time!
That's surprising that with an even <i>meaner</i> starting population,
<span class="tf2t">Copykitten</span>,
a <i>more forgiving</i> version of <span class="tft">Copycat</span>,
was the most successful! (note: <span class="tf2t">Copykitten</span> is so forgiving
it doesn't even <i>entirely</i> wipe out <span class="tft">Copycat</span>. it shares room)
<br><br>
In this case, a bit of "miscommunication" (5% chance of mistake each round) could lead
to more <i>forgiveness</i>. But is this true for <i>all</i> levels...
</p>
<p id="noise_evo_4_2_btn">
...of miscommunication?
</p>

<p id="noise_evo_5">
<b>Use the slider below to change the amount of "miscommunication", then hit START.</b>
At 5%, <span class="tf2t">Copykitten</span> wins.
What happens at 0%? Or 20%? Or 50%? (it only goes up to 50%,
because at that point, <i>every</i> move is a coin flip)
</p>
<p id="noise_evo_5_continue">
When you're done playing around, click:
</p>

<p id="noise_evo_6">
The results turn out something like this:<br>
<b>At 0%,</b> the fair <span class="tft">Copycat</span> wins!
<b>At 1% to 9%,</b> the forgiving <span class="tf2t">Copykitten</span> wins!
<b>At 10% to 49%:</b> the unfair, unforgiving <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> wins.
<b>At 50%,</b> <i>nobody wins ever.</i>
<br><br>
This is why "miscommunication" is such an interesting barrier to trust:
a little bit of it leads to forgiveness,
but too much and it leads to widespread distrust!
<i>The internet has increased our miscommunication</i> much more than than communication...

At last, let's experiment with all peeps, rewards and rules.
Let's play...

<!-- - - - - CONCLUSION! - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="conclusion_0">
Game theory has shown us the three things we need for Trusting Trust:
</p>
<p id="conclusion_1_a">
1. DEEP INTERACTIONS
</p>
<p id="conclusion_1_a2">
It is through silence we can listen to the inner self of ourselves and others.
</p>
<p id="conclusion_2_a">
2. POSSIBLE WIN-WINS
</p>
<p id="conclusion_2_a2">
We must be playing a non-zero-sum game,
a game where it's at least possible that <i>both</i> players can be better -- a win-win.
</p>
<p id="conclusion_3_a">
3. LOW MISCOMMUNICATION
</p>
<p id="conclusion_3_a2">
If the level of miscommunication is <i>too</i> high, trust breaks down.
But when there's a little bit of miscommunication, it pays to be <i>more</i> forgiving.
</p>
<p id="conclusion_4">
Of course, real-world trust is affected by much more than this.
There's culture, reputation, money, promises...
And let's not forget-
</p>
<p id="conclusion_btn">
-the <i>biggest</i> lesson. &rarr;
</p>

<p id="outro_1">

  <br><br><br>
If there's one big takeaway<br>
from <i>any</i> of game theory, it's this:
<br><br>
<b>What the game is, defines what the players do.<br>
What the system is, defines what the people do.
</b><br><br>
In education, politics and business, the game is often about how to cheat.
<br>On a positive note
<b>In the short run, the game defines the players. But in the long run,
it's us players who define the game.</b>
<br><br>
